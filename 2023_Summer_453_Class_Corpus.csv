0,JS_Doc2_The-Debate-About.docx,"President Joe Biden recently took a very public tumble after he tripped on a sandbag and fell while onstage at the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation. This has stirred up renewed speculation about his physical and mental fitness due to his advanced age. 



The fall comes months after he formally announced his bid for reelection in 2024. The president entered the race amid lukewarm support for his reelection bid in polls. An April NBC News poll indicated that a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024 remained unpopular among most voters. Biden's announcement may have clarified questions about his candidacy, but questions about his mental competency and advanced age still loom. The president's age remained a significant issue for nearly half of the respondents against him running for a second term. 



Biden said he respected that voters have questioned his health and mental faculties due to his age and insisted he took that into account when considering whether to run again. ""I took a hard look at it before I decided to run, and I feel good, I feel excited about the prospects,"" Biden said when asked about his age days after announcing his campaign. The most recent report from the president's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, said he was ""fit for duty"" and ""fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""



Why is Biden's age so noteworthy?

President Biden is 80 years old; at age 78, he became the oldest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history. By the end of his term, he'll be 82. Now that Biden has officially confirmed that he's running for reelection, he would be 86 by the end of his second term, eight years older than the average life expectancy for an American male. Ronald Reagan began his second term at the age of 73 and is widely believed to have suffered from Alzheimer's toward the end of his presidency. The median age of American presidents on Inauguration Day is 55.



Is he showing signs of cognitive decline?

Not necessarily. Biden frequently stumbles over his words, but that could be at least partially because of his history with a stutter. Journalist John Hendrickson described Biden's stutter, and his lifelong struggle to control it, as the president's ""most visible weakness"" but also ""the main source of his grit and determination."" Senior care experts note that some forms of dementia can lead to stuttering and that childhood stutters sometimes reemerge among elderly people, especially if they experience an increase in confusion or anxiety.



Last year, in an op-ed for The Hill, Marc Siegel noted that ""at least 15% of those over the age of 75 have some cognitive impairment,"" that the president has several risk factors that could increase the likelihood of cognitive issues, and that the doctor's report following Biden's physical in November 2022 found ""a significant worsening in the president's gait, which in some cases can be related to degenerative disease in the brain or the spinal cord."" That report also concluded that Biden was ""fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""



What are commentators saying about Biden's age? 

It might be ""deeply unfair"" to make assumptions about Biden's capacity to do his job because of his age. In his case, ""it's impossible to deny that politics and conspiracy theories, rather than facts, fuel at least some of the concern,"" The New York Times editorial board opined. Still, Biden and other candidates shouldn't pretend that ""advanced age isn't an issue."" As Biden runs for reelection, he ""will need to provide explicit reassurance to voters; many of them have seen family members decline rapidly in their 80s."" 



Democrats should see Biden's advanced age ""as a not ideal situation but one that's better than the likely alternatives,"" Matthew Cooper wrote in the Washington Monthly. While Biden's satisfactory health reports have been ""less than reassuring,"" Cooper said he has ""been able to do the job well, and he's done it in better physical shape than previous presidents who overcame worse infirmities,"" such as Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. ""Barring a cataclysmic health decline,"" Cooper added, ""Biden will be in better shape in a second term than Reagan, FDR and certainly Wilson."" Biden's age may be ""unprecedented,"" but so would losing with his record, Cooper concluded. 



Based on his unpopularity in recent polls, The Wall Street Journal's editorial board believed the public understands ""that electing an octogenarian in obvious decline for another four years could be a historic mistake."" Asking people to elect a man who's already the oldest president to hold office ""is a risky act that borders on selfish."" While the Journal contended that the White House hides Biden's ""real physical and mental state,"" the editorial board said, ""his decline is clear to anyone who isn't willfully blind. ""



What does polling show?

When Biden was a candidate in the 2020 race, his relatively strong debate performances and pandemic-driven minimalist campaign strategy inspired confidence that, despite his age, Biden was still in full command of his faculties. Just before the 2020 election, voters ""believed [Biden] was mentally fit by a 21-point margin,"" Politico. reported.



That confidence didn't last. By November 2021, 48% of voters said Biden was mentally unfit for office. Three months later, that number was up to 54%.



About three in four Americans surveyed in the April Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll would prefer Biden didn't run again. Only 47% of Democrats polled want to see Biden on the ballot, yet 41% said they would support him if he ran, and another 40% said they might. ""Interviews with poll respondents suggest that the gap reflects concerns about Biden's age,"" the AP explained, ""as well as a clamoring from a younger generation of Democrats who say they want leadership that reflects their demographic and their values."" 



In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 68% of Americans surveyed said Biden was too old for a second term in office. His overall job rating also sunk to 36%, down from 42% in February. Only 34% overall felt that Biden had the mental sharpness to serve as president, and just 30% felt he had the physical fortitude needed for the role. The poll was conducted from April 28 through May 3, 2023, with 1,006 respondents and a margin of error of +/-3.5.



In an NBC poll released in April, 70% of Americans surveyed said Biden should not run for a second term in office, while just 26% said he should. Among Democrats, 51% voted against Biden seeking a second term, while 48% of those against Biden running said his age was a major factor in that stance. Former President Donald Trump, who has also officially put in his bid, didn't fare much better with the poll respondents, with 60% against him running again. The survey was taken from April 14 through 18, with 1,000 respondents and a margin of error of +/-3.1."
1,JS_Doc1_Should-Joe-Biden.docx,"Ageism is the last acceptable ‘ism.’ There is no better example of this than the mainstream media’s comfort in calling Biden out – about his age. After today’s formal announcement of his campaign, the torrent of outrage will be unleashed. It’s already been a constant, critical under-current of his presidency. The New York Times published an editorial this weekend in expectation of his re-election run, calling for him to act his age. Or at least talk about it. Would they have written anything similar about his race, his gender or his Irish heritage?

“If Mr. Biden runs again,” the NYT writes, “…questions will persist about his age until he does more to assure voters that he is up to the job.” Would they have made a similar recommendation to Obama to address his race ‘to assure voters that he was up to the job’? Or suggest to the next woman who dares run for US President that she address the questions that will just as surely persist about her gender?

The degree to which age remains a free target of attack is curious in our new era of remarkable longevity. The demographics of almost every country on the planet has been trending older. Societies are ageing fast, and the US is no exception. Science has gifted us an extra three to four decades of life expectancy in just the last century. You would think this would be something to be celebrated. The US could be proud of the vibrancy of its modern elders rather than disparage their abilities and question their competence.

But Americans are fearful. Of his age and their own future ageing. A weekend NBC poll showed a majority of people who think Biden shouldn’t run cited his age as a concern, with 48 percent saying it was a ""major concern"". The BBC interviewed some 80-year-olds who mostly seemed to resent the question, citing ageism. “The satire and the sneering about him are ageist,” says one eloquent woman. “Some people at 60 should go nowhere near political power.”

Today’s Senate, notes the NYT’s editors, is the second oldest since 1789. That makes sense, because the US invented a lot of the science that has more than doubled life expectancy since that time. They call Biden “a complete outlier” because of his age. Yet China’s Xi Jinping is 69, India’s Modi is 72, Turkey’s Erdogan is 69 and Russia’s Putin is 70. Rather than being an outlier, Biden and this bunch are examples of leadership in an age of longevity. Like or loathe their politics, at least Biden knows what he is up against. In the job he is running for, experience matters. He’s got something few Presidents before him have. Literally decades of knowledge, networks and connections. Including a deep familiarity with his global peers, allies, competitors and bogeymen.

He is, like many other knowledge workers the world over, able to continue working for many years beyond what we used to think of as retirement age. That’s a problem, not because Biden is obsolete, but because our biases are. Most employers are loathe to recruit, invest or promote older workers. They aren’t yet used to our new longevity or its multi-faceted consequences. Most aren’t even measuring it yet. Biden’s presidency has helped to redefine what older humans are capable of in the most impactful way of all. Not by talking about his age. But by doing a good job.

His first two years in office were described as “among the most productive of any president in the past half century.” He managed to push through a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law - as well as the biggest package of climate measures in US history. But he’s regularly spoofed or questioned for his age, from both sides of the American political aisle. Maybe it takes an external perspective to see the benefits of Biden without the distorting debate about his age. Kind of like being a bit embarrassed about your parents’ overly familiar lapses. From the UK, The Financial Times’ Gideon Rachman wrote an article titled “Joe Biden’s claim to Presidential Greatness,” explaining that “at home and abroad he is already a formidably successful leader.”

Most of us are likely to live and work far longer than we think. Like Biden, many of us may only achieve our dreams and goals at unimaginably later ages than we had expected. Imagine what this President may yet teach us all about our own possibilities and potential with another four years."
2,JMK_Doc1_ A-Final-Report-Card-on-the-States-Response-to-COVID-19.docx,"For our unemployment measure, we looked at the cumulative months of unemployment (total unemployed over the period divided by total labor force over the period) from April 2020 to December 2021 and for each state subtracted the period of the same measure from January 2019 to February 2020. That is the raw unemployment metric. Hawaii and Nevada came in last by far because of the overwhelming impact the global shutdown of tourism had on them, and energy-heavy states similarly had disproportionate unemployment rises with the collapse of global demand. Because we considered these industry factors independent of state performance, we adjusted for industry composition. We used a regression model to perform the adjustment. Let ys denote a health or economic outcome in state s during the pandemic, such as excess mortality or the number of points that the pandemic-average unemployment rate exceeded the pre-pandemic average. Let xs denote a vector of industry composition (or health status) variables for state s, expressed as a deviation from the national average. In our baseline economic specification, the vector has two elements: the share of state employment mining (which includes energy) and the share in leisure and hospitality. To adjust a pandemic outcome from the industry composition of its economy, we use the following multivariate linear regression equation. School closures may ultimately prove to be the most costly policy decision of the pandemic era in both economic and mortality terms. One study found that school closures at the end of the previous 2019-2020 school year are associated with 13.8 million years of life lost. An NIH analysis found that life expectancy for high school graduates is 4 to 6 years longer than high school dropouts. The OECD estimates that learning losses from pandemic era school closures could cause a 3% decline in lifetime earnings, and that a loss of just one third of a year of learning has a long-term economic impact of $14 trillion. Unlike mortality or economic outcomes, closing public schools was entirely under the control of policymakers. Almost all private schools were open. There is no clear pattern in which states had high and low mortality, although we note one major study from Rand Corporation researchers found that lockdowns increased all-cause mortality to a statistically significant extent. Whether or not political leaders can be considered responsible for mortality outcomes is therefore unclear, although advocates of a ""focused protection"" strategy have suggested that sheltering the high-risk could reduce overall mortality – an approach adopted by Florida. Because COVID infection mortality risk is extremely age-related -- 8700 times higher in age 85+ than in 5 to 17, according to the CDC – we applied an age-adjustment to the number of observed deaths in each age group to bring the numbers in line with a standard U.S. population. Because CDC suppresses totals of less than 10, we combined ages less than 35, but because there are few deaths in that age range it should not affect the accuracy of the adjustment. Pandemic mortality was greater in states where obesity, diabetes, and old age were more prevalent before the pandemic. Economic activity was less in states that had been intensive in, especially, accommodations and food. Still, much residual variation in both mortality and economic activity remains even after controlling for these factors because the 50 states and DC took very different approaches to confronting the Covid pandemic. Three states stand out as having combined scores well above the others: Utah, Nebraska, and Vermont. They were substantially above average in all three categories. Six more states followed, including Montana and South Dakota almost two standard deviations above the average in terms of economy but 0.8 to 1.0 below in terms of mortality (i.e., higher death rates). New Hampshire and Maine were about 1.5 standard deviations above average on mortality while also somewhat above average economically. Although sometimes criticized as having policies that were “too open,” Florida proved to have average mortality while maintaining a high level of economic activity and 96 percent open schools. 2 While we combined the three categories using z-scores, future research could consider weights reflecting revealed preference. Philipson and Sun’s (2020) international comparisons weight economy and mortality based on the value of a statistical life, which is founded on revealed preference studies. As detailed pandemic-era migration data become available, they could also help inform how the pandemic changed the quality of life by state. As a teaser, we note that the four states with the most negative per-capita rates of net migration from July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021 – DC, NY, IL, and CA – were all in the bottom six in terms of our composite scores (U.S. Census Bureau 2021)."
3,JMK_Doc2_Variation-in-US-states-COVID-19-policy-responses.docx,"Even as US policymakers passed important pandemic milestones, common debates around COVID-19 responses remain. What policies might implement, for how long, and whether they affect behavior all remain open questions from the beginning of the pandemic. These open questions have taken on new urgency in the US as states move to reopen amid ongoing vaccinations and hopes that the worst spikes of the winter months might be left behind—even as new variants and declining vaccination rates threaten progress gained. Substantiating patterns in states policy, inter- and intra-state variation in decision making, and policies’ relationship to external data such as vaccination rates and mobility provide starting points to these questions as the US enters a new phase of the pandemic. We have identified the first months of 2021 as a period defined by reopening and continued state control, with certain policy areas such as gathering restrictions, workplace closures, and mask wearing dropping precipitously in the new year. While federal action on COVID-19 policy remains mostly confined to updated guidance and logistical involvement in vaccine distribution, federal leadership did alter policy experiences across several indicators tracked by OxCGRT, including mask wearing, school reopening, and vaccination eligibility policies. Familiar patterns continued in state policy variation. While divergence in stringency lessened as more states moved toward phases of reopening, Northeastern and Democrat-led states maintained the most stringent policies, while Midwestern, Southern and Republican-led states making up the states with the least stringent ongoing responses. Throughout all regions, geographically-targeted policies remained common as state-wide policies were lifted, and city or county levels took center stage. Mobility data supports these trends, showing that lessened policy stringency coincided with less time at home, and more time at non-essential retail settings. Periods of high policy stringency were followed by gradual movement toward ‘normal’ mobility, hinting at possible effects of policy fatigue. In many ways, these familiar policy actions were overshadowed by 2021’s main event— vaccination campaigns. The US has remained unique in its privileged access to several effective vaccines and decentralized distribution, factors making study of its subnational rollout policies especially crucial. Vaccine eligibility policies followed similar broad patterns. December and January saw limited vaccine eligibility and accessed, focused on healthcare workers and care home residents in line with CDC guidance. But as time went on and vaccine supplies expanded, states began to diverge in their rollout specifics. Key variance occurred in definitions of essential workers, prioritizations of certain groups, and decisions about whether to pursue primarily agebased or occupation-based vaccination rollouts. And while states faced logistical and supply shortages through February and March that at times limited expansion of eligible categories, the tide began to turn toward vaccine eligibility for all 16+ individuals by the beginning of April, with all states reaching the federal deadline of April 19 for expanding eligibility to all adults in the state. This promises to remain a dynamic policy area as the world grapples with variants and inequitable vaccine access, and the US moves toward vaccinating children and fights waning interest in vaccination amid the population. 51 It is imperative to study which measures are effective (and which are not) to both limit COVID-19 spread and reduce disruption to life and livelihood. While the OxCGRT data presented is descriptive and cannot measure effectiveness of different policy measures directly, they can be useful input to studies that analyze factors affecting disease progression. OxCGRT seeks to contribute to this knowledge gap by providing efficient and simple comparisons of government interventions and individual policy actions in the US, as well as several comparable aggregate indices and risk of openness measures. These provide a starting point for building evidence-based policies and assessing effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions. It is our hope that scholars, medical professionals, policymakers, and concerned citizens alike will use the OxCGRT data to inform and improve responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data will continue to be updated on a regular basis, and will be refined and improved over time. The most up-to-date technical documentation can always be found on our GitHub repository.43 44 We welcome constructive feedback and collaboration on this project as it evolves."
4,BW_Doc3_Climate_Existential.docx,"In his second State of the Union address, U.S. president Joe Biden briefly highlighted the threat of climate change and its hazardous impacts while providing reassurances that the country’s reliance on oil and gas would continue for “a while.”

“Let’s face reality. The climate crisis doesn’t care if you’re in a red or blue state. It’s an existential threat,” Biden said in his 7 February address. “We have an obligation, not to ourselves, but to our children and our grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America at last is stepping up to the challenge.”

Climate scientists reacting to the speech were simultaneously excited that climate and environmental issues garnered a few minutes of coveted airtime and disappointed that the president did not go farther in offering solutions.

“Historic” Climate Progress

In 2022, the Biden administration passed the most ambitious climate legislation in U.S. history, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The law promises a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, provides tax credits on electric vehicles, directs 40% of the benefits of those investments to communities most affected by climate impacts, and could cut the social costs of climate change by up to $1.9 billion by 2050

The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the 2022 Chips and Science Act also aim to combat climate change by investing in green energy and creating new energy-efficient infrastructure. In his address, the president touted his wins with all three pieces of climate-relevant legislation.

“President Biden has overseen more climate progress than any other U.S. president.”

“President Biden has overseen more climate progress than any other U.S. president” with these laws, said Leah Stokes, a political scientist who specializes in energy and climate politics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She called the IRA “historic.”

Ahead of the speech, Stokes commented that “climate change is a top issue for voters.…Americans need to know how much climate progress we made in 2022, including all the money that’s now available for them to purchase clean technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles.”

“It’s also critical that President Biden chart a course for the future,” she said. She had hoped that Biden’s address would do this, but it did not. “We want to know how he plans to pair effective IRA implementation with ambitious executive action to achieve his justice and climate goals.”

However, like other U.S. environmental policies, the IRA’s goals are still “dependent on the historical ways in which U.S. energy and infrastructure has developed” with a reliance on fossil fuels, said Andrea Simonelli, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.

Mixed Signals

Biden mentioned some of the devastating impacts of climate change, including wildfires, flooding, storms, and drought, but also assured the nation that “we’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.” The president recently green-lighted a multibillion-dollar oil drilling project in the Alaska wilderness just after finalizing protections for the state’s Tongass National Forest"
5,FM_Doc2_What_Are_Presdent.docx,"Yet since he took office last year, the US has seen a record influx of migrants at its southern border, prompting criticism of the administration's policies from across the political spectrum.

Officials are now bracing for a potentially massive influx of migrants over the summer following the expected end of Title 42, a pandemic policy that allows migrants to be quickly expelled over concerns about spreading Covid-19.

Why the spike under Biden?

While the number of migrants at the border has been steadily increasing since April 2020, the numbers spiked sharply after Mr Biden took office.

How do they get into the US?

Migrants cross the border in one of two ways. Those who believe they ""have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution"" in their home country are eligible to apply for asylum when they present themselves at a port of entry for admission into the US.

According to the Pew Research Center, at least 40% of unauthorised migrants in the country entered legally on short-term visas and overstayed.

Biden defends a Trump policy

On Covid, Mr Biden had kept a Trump-era emergency policy to automatically expel almost all undocumented migrants seeking entry, bypassing normal immigration laws and protections.

The policy - known as Title 42 - was aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 in holding facilities, officials said.

The measure sparked controversy within his party.

After twice extending it, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decided to end the policy on 23 May. The CDC said it was ""no longer necessary"" to maintain Title 42 given the current, more favourable public health outlook in the US.

Remain in Mexico policy

On Mr Biden's first day in office, his administration suspended a controversial Trump-era policy that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings.

Since it was introduced in January 2019, about 70,000 migrants were enrolled in the programme informally known as Remain in Mexico.

But a ruling by a Trump-appointed federal court judge in Texas found that the administration had improperly cancelled the policy so it was restarted in December.

The US Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on its future later this week.

Separating families

One of the most substantive changes in border policy under Mr Biden has been a shift in how the government deals with migrant families.

A so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy under Mr Trump meant families divided by US authorities, in some cases with parents being deported back to their home countries without their children.

Mr Biden has reversed that specific practice, and some families - but not all - have been reunited.

A task force set up by the president estimated that 3,913 children had been separated from their parents.

As of November, authorities were still trying to reach the parents of 270 children separated from their families, according to a court filing.

Unaccompanied children

As mandated by US anti-trafficking laws, Mr Biden's administration has been transferring non-Mexican minors to shelters overseen by the government."
6,CGL_Doc3_Western-Goods-Still-Flowing-to-Russia.docx,"BERLIN—A group of former Soviet republics has emerged as a major transshipment hub for U.S. and European computer chips, lasers and other products with civilian and military uses headed for Russia, according to Western officials and data compiled by The Wall Street Journal.

U.S. and European Union exports of sensitive, so-called dual-use goods to countries in Russia’s neighborhood rose sharply in 2022. So did these countries’ shipments of these products to Russia, often by a similar multiple, an analysis of United Nations trade data shows.

The data suggests Moscow continues to acquire crucial Western goods—whose sale is mostly restricted by U.S. and European sanctions—as it seeks to keep its economy afloat and its war machine running.

In total, U.S. and EU goods exports to Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan rose to $24.3 billion last year from $14.6 billion in 2021. These countries collectively increased their exports to Russia by nearly 50% last year to around $15 billion.

Former Soviet states increased their imports from the U.S. and EU by more than $9 billion in 2022. At the same time, their exports to Russia increased by nearly $5 billion.

This booming trade route—which analysts at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development call the Eurasian roundabout—is a sign of Russia’s success in finding new ways to acquire sought-after goods despite Western sanctions, European officials say.

Russian companies advertise their ability to acquire sanctioned goods this way. For example, Imex-Expert offers to “import sanctioned goods from Europe, America to Russia through Kazakhstan.” Its website boasts: “Bypassing sanctions 100%.”

The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Digging into the numbers shows a substantial trade in dual-use items. The U.S. and the EU exported more than $8.5 million worth of integrated circuits to Armenia last year, for instance, more than 16 times the $530,000 exported in 2021, according to U.N. data.

At the same time, Armenia’s exports of the circuits to Russia jumped to $13 million from less than $2,000 in 2021.

A similar picture emerges with Western shipments of lasers to Kyrgyzstan and measuring instruments, including tools for checking voltage and power, to Uzbekistan. Both countries saw a boost in those exports to Russia.

Washington and Brussels have barred the sale to Russia of various types of these goods since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

While the amount of trade between the former Soviet republics and Russia is small compared with Russia’s trade with China, which has become Russia’s main supplier and economic backstop, the new trade route allows Moscow to get its hands on Western technology it has trouble getting elsewhere.

Such technologies are critical for Russia’s war in Ukraine, experts say. Russia has limited ability to replace Western components with its own products."
7,AT_Doc2_The-Full-Legislative.docx,"The full legislative text of Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s agreement in principle with President Biden to suspend the nation’s borrowing limit revealed new and important details about the deal, which House lawmakers are expected to vote on this week.



The centerpiece of the agreement remains a two-year suspension of the debt ceiling, which caps the total amount of money the government is allowed to borrow. Suspending that cap, which is now set at $31.4 trillion, would allow the government to keep borrowing money and pay its bills on time — as long as Congress passes the agreement before June 5, when Treasury has said the United States will run out of cash.



In exchange for suspending the limit, Republicans demanded a range of policy concessions from Mr. Biden. Chief among them are limits on the growth of federal discretionary spending over the next two years. Mr. Biden also agreed to some new work requirements for certain recipients of food stamps and the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program.



Both sides agreed to modest efforts meant to accelerate the permitting of some energy projects — and, in a surprise move, a fast track to construction for a new natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia that has been championed by Republican lawmakers and a key centrist Democrat.



Here’s what the legislation would do:



Temporarily suspends the debt limit

The deal suspends the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing limit until Jan. 2025. Suspending the debt limit for a period of time is different than setting it at a new fixed level. It essentially gives the Treasury Department the latitude to borrow as much money as it needs to pay the nation’s bills during that time period, plus a few months after the limit is reached, as the department employs accounting maneuvers to keep up payments.



That’s different than the bill passed by House Republicans, which raised the limit by $1.5 trillion or through March 2024, whichever came first.



Under the new legislation, the debt limit will be set at whatever level it has reached when the suspension ends. For political reasons, Republicans tend to prefer suspending the debt limit rather than raising it, because it allows them to say they did not technically green-light a higher debt limit.



The suspension will kick the next potential fight over the nation’s debt load to 2025 — past the next presidential election.



Caps and cuts spending

The bill cuts so-called nondefense discretionary, which includes domestic law enforcement, forest management, scientific research and more — for the 2024 fiscal year. It would limit all discretionary spending to 1 percent growth in 2025, which is effectively a budget cut, because that is projected to be slower than the rate of inflation.





The legislative text and White House officials tell different stories about how big those cuts actually are.



Understand the Debt Limit Deal

Lifting the debt ceiling. The deal reached by President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy will suspend the nation’s debt limit until January 2025. This will allow the government to keep borrowing money so it can pay its bills on time."
8,AK_Doc2_Benefits_Disappear_COVID.docx,"President Joe Biden intends to end the Covid-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, the White House said Monday. That means that many Americans could have to start paying for Covid-19 testing and treatment after the declarations cease. The public health emergency has enabled the government to provide many Americans with Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines at no charge. “People will have to start paying some money for things they didn’t have to pay for during the emergency,” said Jen Kates, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.



Those covered by Medicare and Medicaid have also had certain therapeutic treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies, fully covered. Once the emergency ends, Medicare beneficiaries generally will face out-of-pocket costs for at-home testing and all treatment. However, vaccines will continue to be covered at no cost, as will testing ordered by a health care provider. Those with private insurance could face charges for lab tests, even if they are ordered by a provider. Vaccinations will continue to be free for those with private insurance who go to in-network providers, but going to an out-of-network providers could incur charges.



The federal government has been preparing to shift Covid-19 care to the commercial market since last year, in part because Congress has not authorized additional funding to purchase additional vaccines, treatments and tests. Pfizer and Moderna have already announced that the commercial prices of their Covid-19 vaccines will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose. 



The public health emergency has also meant additional funds for hospitals, which have been receiving a 20% increase in Medicare’s payment rate for treating Covid-19 patients. Also, Medicare Advantage plans have been required to bill enrollees affected by the emergency and receiving care at out-of-network facilities the same as if they were at in-network facilities. This will end once the public health emergency expires. 



Congress, however, extended one set of pandemic flexibilities as part of the government funding package. More Medicare enrollees are able to get care via telehealth during the public health emergency. The service is no longer limited just to those living in rural areas. They can conduct the telehealth visit at home, rather than having to travel to a health care facility. Plus, beneficiaries can use smartphones and receive a wider array of services via telehealth. These will now continue through 2024.



The administration is actively reviewing flexible policies that were authorized under the public health emergency to determine which can remain in place after it is lifted on May 11. Declaring an end to the public health emergency will also end the border restriction known as Title 42, which will also likely set up a showdown on Capitol Hill."
9,CGL_Doc1_US-Allies-Sanction-Russia.docx,"The U.S. and its European allies are imposing a widening array of economic penalties on Russia in punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, and pressure for tougher action is rising after Ukraine alleged that Russian forces committed potential war crimes against civilians. Punitive measures rolled out so far target Russia’s financial sector, major companies, President Vladimir Putin, his daughters, other government officials, members of Russia’s elite and the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline. The U.S. and European governments say more are forthcoming.

Economic sanctions, export controls and other measures became the main tools of retaliation for the West after President Biden said that the U.S. wouldn’t send troops to defend Ukraine, which isn’t a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 

Mr. Biden vowed that the measures would be crippling. European allies have followed suit and introduced separate penalties, showing a unity of purpose that often eluded past sanctions efforts by the U.S. Iconic Western multinationals, from Apple Inc. and Boeing Co. to Exxon Mobil Corp. and PepsiCo, have pulled back or curtailed their Russian operations in protest of the invasion, to avoid running afoul of the penalties or because sanctions are hampering delivering goods and getting paid.

As Russia’s invasion presses on, some possible punishments initially left off the target list are being brought on. The U.S. and its allies in Europe overcame differences and agreed to disconnect some Russian banks from Swift, the financial-messaging infrastructure that links the world’s banks. After initial resistance, they are also taking action against Russia’s energy sector.

Biden administration officials have said some of the penalties, like the blacklisting of major banks, are designed to reverberate immediately through the Russian economy, while others, such as export controls on certain technology products, would exact pain on Russian industrial and defense sectors over the longer term. Meanwhile, concerns remain that Russia could use its oil and gas exports as a weapon, as some Russian officials have suggested, disrupting markets and raising the costs to European and other consumers, but also adding to Russia’s economic woes.

What are the latest sanctions and other measures to be issued?

The U.S. and European Union are making Russia’s financial system a prime target and are beginning to target its energy sector. They are also withdrawing from Russia the low-tariff trade status accorded to almost all nations. The goal, the allies say, is to curtail the Kremlin’s ability to wage war.

The U.S. and EU blocked the Russian central bank from selling dollars, euros and other foreign currencies in its reserves stockpile, constraining its ability to stabilize the ruble and fight inflation. Sanctions placed on a Russian sovereign-wealth fund also limit Russia’s ability to raise money abroad.

The U.S., EU, the U.K. and Canada started to remove some Russian banks from the Swift financial network, hampering their ability to operate globally.

The U.S. imposed full-blocking sanctions on VTB and Sberbank, Russia’s biggest financial institutions, freezing any assets held by U.S. financial institutions and barring any transactions involving the banks from American financial networks. The Biden administration also placed blocking sanctions on Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s largest private banks. Dozens of other financial institutions have been added to sanctions rolls. All told, the Treasury Department said, the actions target 80% of all banking assets in Russia and limit the country’s access to the global financial system."
10,JS_Doc3_Remaking-Pollution-Fight.docx,"You’ve Never Heard of Him, but He’s Remaking the Pollution Fight

Richard Revesz is changing the way the government calculates the cost and benefits of regulation, with far-reaching implications for climate change.

Mr. Revesz, 65, heads the obscure but powerful White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is effectively the gatekeeper and final word on all new federal regulations. 

Mr. Revesz, a climate law expert and former dean of the New York University School of Law, joined the Biden administration in January. 

What’s more, he has proposed a new method of calculating the cost of potential regulation that would bolster the legal and economic justifications for those rules

Until now, such analyses have been chiefly based on the current cost of a regulation to industry, compared against the benefits to society. Mr. Revesz’s alteration would emphasize how a regulation would benefit future generations.

The change would affect the metric that the federal government uses to calculate the harm caused by one ton of carbon dioxide pollution. In the Obama administration, White House economists calculated that number at roughly $50 a ton. In the Trump administration, they lowered it to less than $5 a ton. Applying Mr. Revesz’s formula shoots up the cost to nearly $200 a ton.

Current methods weigh the impact of a proposed regulation on the population as a whole. But poor and minority communities face greater exposure to pollution, so they would reap greater benefits from limits on that pollution.

Mr. Stavins and some other economists say the approach taken by Mr. Revesz is the most accurate way to analyze the impact of climate rules. “That’s the right way to think about it and the right way to do it,” Mr. Stavins said.

Critics say the changes would result in greater government interference in American life and harm businesses.

“It will certainly justify much more aggressive regulation, especially of greenhouse gas emissions, and that would almost certainly increase the cost of energy, which flows through to the cost of goods and services” said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer with Bracewell LLP, who represents fossil fuel companies and electric utilities

Susan Dudley, who headed the regulatory office in the George W. Bush administration and now directs the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, said Mr. Revesz appears to be trying to achieve a progressive agenda.

“To me there is a danger there — the previous guidelines from Reagan, Clinton and Bush were all seen as neutral, objective and focused on efficiency,” she said. “I think it won’t survive a Republican administration.”

Mr. Revesz says he is simply modernizing a method of calculations that was last updated during the George W. Bush administration. 

“If you do exactly the same arithmetic with exactly the same formula with the most recent 30 years,” the result places a higher dollar value on future lives, Mr. Revesz said at a recent discussion at George Washington University."
11,AT_Doc3_With-Just-Two.docx,"With just two days to spare, President Joe Biden signed legislation on Saturday that lifts the nation’s debt ceiling, averting an unprecedented default on the federal government’s debt.



The White House announced the signing, done in private at the White House, in an emailed statement in which Biden thanked congressional leaders for their partnership.



The Treasury Department had warned that the country would start running short of cash to pay all of its bills on Monday, which would have sent shockwaves through the U.S. and global economies.



Republicans refused to raise the country’s borrowing limit unless Democrats agreed to cut spending, leading to a standoff that was not resolved until weeks of intense negotiations between the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.



The final agreement, passed by the House on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday, suspends the debt limit until 2025 — after the next presidential election — and restricts government spending. It gives lawmakers budget targets for the next two years in hopes of assuring fiscal stability as the political season heats up.



Raising the nation’s debt limit, now at $31.4 trillion, will ensure that the government can borrow to pay debts already incurred.



“Passing this budget agreement was critical. The stakes could not have been higher,” Biden said from the Oval Office on Friday evening. “Nothing would have been more catastrophic,” he said, than defaulting on the country’s debt.



“No one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they needed,” Biden said, highlighting the “compromise and consensus” in the deal. “We averted an economic crisis and an economic collapse.”



Biden used the opportunity to itemize the achievements of his first term as he runs for reelection, including support for high-tech manufacturing, infrastructure investments and financial incentives for fighting climate change. He also highlighted ways he blunted Republican efforts to roll back his agenda and achieve deeper cuts.



“We’re cutting spending and bringing deficits down at the same time,” Biden said. “We’re protecting important priorities from Social Security to Medicare to Medicaid to veterans to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean energy.”



Even as he pledged to continue working with Republicans, Biden also drew contrasts with the opposing party, particularly when it comes to raising taxes on the wealthy, something the Democratic president has sought.



It’s something he suggested may need to wait until a second term.



“I’m going to be coming back,” he said. “With your help, I’m going to win.”





Biden’s remarks were the most detailed comments from the Democratic president on the compromise he and his staff negotiated. He largely remained quiet publicly during the high-stakes talks, a decision that frustrated some members of his party but was intended to give space for both sides to reach a deal and for lawmakers to vote it to his desk.



Biden praised McCarthy and his negotiators for operating in good faith, and all congressional leaders for ensuring swift passage of the legislation. “They acted responsibly, and put the good of the country ahead of politics,” he said."

13,FM_Doc1_Democrats__Phalanx_Around.docx,"The New York mayor has loudly blamed President Biden for an influx of migrants, amplifying concerns many Democrats share but irritating Mr. Biden’s aides and weakening his political position.

The Democratic Party is following a standard strategy as President Biden seeks re-election: Do not criticize him publicly under any circumstances, lest it help Donald J. Trump or one of his acolytes take back the White House for Republicans.

Mr. Adams has taken nearly every opportunity in recent weeks to publicly blame Mr. Biden or his administration for the influx of migrants to New York from border states, many of them on buses dispatched by Republican governors.

His eagerness to point a finger at the White House has infuriated top Biden aides, who note the issue’s global complexity. At the same time, the mayor is using his platform to amplify concerns many Democrats share but will not articulate publicly because they don’t want to hurt the president.

“We have reached out to the White House on a number of occasions and stated clearly the things we need,” Mr. Adams said Wednesday. “Allow people to work, which I believe that’s one of the No. 1 things we can do. Allow people to work. And do a decompression strategy at the border. We got 108,000 cities and towns and villages. Why aren’t we spreading this out throughout the entire country?”

Since becoming mayor 17 months ago on a platform of taming disorder on city streets, Mr. Adams has repeatedly broken ranks with the Democratic Party. Last year, his language on crime mirrored attacks by New York Republicans as they helped flip the House and mounted a strong challenge to Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Now, some Democrats worry that Mr. Adams’s messaging on migrants will again undercut Mr. Biden, placing the president at odds with a high-profile ally and seeming to strengthen the arguments of Republican governors like Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida that he is weak on border security.

“Abbott and DeSantis and whoever are getting what they want: They got everybody at each other’s throats,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime Adams ally who has tried to serve as a middleman between the mayor and the White House. “On a scale of 1 to 10, it’s a 12 in frustration, and sometimes in frustration it can come off as more adversarial than you would like.”

Mr. Biden’s aides and allies in Washington — a half dozen of whom spoke about their private discussions on the condition of anonymity — are clearly irritated with the mayor. In their view, Mr. Adams is a grandstanding opportunist, aiming to win headlines for himself without regard to the broader political implications for the president and his re-election.

Last year, some White House officials were annoyed when Mr. Adams released a public letter asking for more monkeypox vaccines and calling the White House’s approach “piecemeal” after it had already told Mr. Adams privately that he would receive the vaccine shipments he had requested."
14,CGL_Doc2_Sanctions-Mark-Tectonic-Shift.docx,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago prompted a volley of tough sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, a historic use of economic measures that will likely have lasting implications for businesses.

Financial crime experts widely agree that the imposition of large sanctions packages by the U.S. and other countries on Russia marks a watershed moment in the use of economic measures as a tool of foreign policy. The U.S. and allies spearheaded a new kind of sanctions strategy: targeted, coordinated and aimed at causing maximum pain to a globally significant economy.

“We’ve never had such a significant economy have such significant sanctions placed upon it with such speed,” said Daniel Tannebaum, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who is a partner at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman LLC. 

More than 1,000 businesses curtailed operations in Russia following the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, according to data compiled by researchers at Yale School of Management.

Businesses have found that the government’s approach of leaning on economic levers rather than other government tools, such as direct military intervention, has put them on the forefront of the Western foreign policy push. 

The sanctions weren’t comprehensive, and left many businesses with avenues to continue their operations. Hundreds of companies, though, decamped, calculating that the looming threat of sanctions ratcheting up and reputational risk warranted an exit.

“The tectonic plates have really shifted here,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale researcher who has tracked companies’ exodus from Russia, on the widespread decision by businesses to depart. “There’s nothing like it, not just in recent history, or in our lifetime.”

Prof. Sonnenfeld said about six times as many major businesses have cut operations in Russia as did in South Africa during the apartheid-era collective boycotts of the 1980s, a response to the economic measures and the accompanying reputational risks of staying in the country, he said.

A debate persists over whether the sanctions are effective. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said earlier this week that the U.S. had succeeded in undercutting Russia’s military industrial complex, pointing to a range of economic and other metrics. Regardless, the increase in sanctions volume compared with past conflicts is undeniable. Compliance staff at businesses have faced what many see as an unprecedented expansion of their sanctions-related workload.

Russia since the sanctions push of 2022 has effectively been relegated to a much smaller role in the global economy, particularly as European companies realigned their supply chains, said Lindsay Newman, head of geopolitical thought leadership for S&P Global Market Intelligence. 

Sanctions have enjoyed widespread political backing, including bipartisan support in the U.S., in part because they allow countries to pursue their foreign policy goals relatively cheaply and without committing their armies to fight, Dr. Newman said.

“The defining feature of this geopolitical landscape is this increasing interdependence between economic and security spheres,” she said. “Countries continue to rely on those tools for foreign policy. Business is left having to navigate it.”"
15,AK_Doc1_Biden_End_Emerg.docx,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden informed Congress on Monday that he will end the twin national emergencies for addressing COVID-19 on May 11, as most of the world has returned closer to normalcy nearly three years after they were first declared. The move to end the national emergency and public health emergency declarations would formally restructure the federal coronavirus response. 



It comes as lawmakers have already ended elements of the emergencies that kept millions of Americans insured during the pandemic. Biden’s announcement comes in a statement opposing resolutions being brought to the floor this week by House Republicans to bring the emergency to an immediate end. 



Then-President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar first declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, and Trump later declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency that March. The emergencies have been repeatedly extended by Biden since he took office in January 2021, and are set to expire in the coming months. 



“An abrupt end to the emergency declarations would create wide-ranging chaos and uncertainty throughout the health care system — for states, for hospitals and doctors’ offices, and, most importantly, for tens of millions of Americans,” the Office of Management and Budget wrote in a Statement of Administration Policy. 



Congress has already blunted the reach of the public health emergency that had the most direct impact on Americans. “In some respects, the Biden administration is catching up to what a lot of people in the country have been experiencing,” said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser Family Foundation. 



The costs of COVID-19 vaccines are also expected to skyrocket once the government stops buying them. Only 15% of Americans have received the recommended, updated booster that has been offered since last fall. 



Legislators did extend for another two years telehealth flexibilities that were introduced as COVID-19 hit. The Biden administration had previously considered ending the emergency last year, but held off amid concerns about a potential “winter surge” in cases and to provide adequate time for providers, insurers and patients to prepare for its end.



Officials said the administration would use the next three months to transition the response to conventional methods. “To be clear, continuation of these emergency declarations until May 11 does not impose any restriction at all on individual conduct with regard to COVID-19,” the administration said. 



Moments before the White House’s announcement, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., accused the president of unnecessarily extending the public health emergency. “The country has largely returned to normal,” Cole said Monday, introducing a Republican-backed bill calling for an end to the health emergency. 



The House was scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation that would terminate the public health emergency. The bill’s author, Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said he still hopes the House will proceed with a vote. He said he was surprised by the White House move, but thinks the legislation may have played a role in prompting the administration to act."
16,BW_Doc2_Divided_Climate.docx,"More than a year into Joe Biden’s presidency, the public is divided over the administration’s approach to climate change: 49% of U.S. adults say the Biden administration’s policies on climate change are taking the country in the right direction, while 47% say these climate policies are taking the country in the wrong direction.

Climate change has been among the top priorities of the Biden administration, whose actions on the issue include rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and passage of an infrastructure bill with funding for renewable energy. More recent legislative efforts on climate have stalled in Congress, and a Supreme Court decision in June curtailed the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate power plant emissions.

Ratings of Biden’s approach to climate change – and the federal government’s role dealing with the issue – are deeply partisan. A majority of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP (82%) say Biden’s climate policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, most say Biden is moving the country in the right direction on climate policy (79%).

But in a sign of Democratic frustration with progress tackling climate change, there’s discontent within the party even among those who say Biden’s policies are taking the country in the right direction. Among Democrats who back the direction of the administration’s climate policies, 61% say the administration could be doing a lot more on climate; far fewer (37%) say they are doing about as much as can be expected. 

While the public is divided over Biden’s approach to climate change, a majority of Americans continue to see room for more federal action on the issue: 58% say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of global climate change, compared with just 18% who say it is doing too much (22% say it is doing about the right amount). Here again, partisan differences are wide, with Democrats much more likely than Republicans to say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change (82% vs. 28%).

Despite these polarized attitudes, the Pew Research Center survey of 10,282 U.S. adults conducted from May 2 to 8, 2022, finds broad public agreement on some specific policies to address climate change. A large majority of Americans (90%) say they favor planting about a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions to help reduce the effects of climate change, and 79% favor providing a tax credit to encourage businesses to develop technology to capture and store carbon emissions. Both of these policies are backed by sizable majorities of Republicans and Democrats alike.

The survey, fielded before the Supreme Court’s decision limiting the EPA’s authority to regulate power plant emissions, finds 72% of Americans favor requiring power companies to use more energy from renewable sources, like wind and solar, and 68% back taxing corporations based on the amount of carbon emissions they produce. Partisan gaps are more pronounced on these"
17,JS_Doc3_The-Awkward-Issue.docx,"On no topic is the bifurcation of America’s media more evident than that of the president’s age. To the conservative media world, Joe Biden’s imagined senility is a staple. Republican figures routinely call for him to take cognitive tests. The term “dementia” is bandied about. By contrast, the closest traditional outlets have come to addressing Biden’s age is a spate of reports into the low ratings of his vice-president, Kamala Harris. For them, it is as if openly acknowledging Biden’s advancing years would validate the conspiracy mongers.



That is a mistake. There is no reason to think that Biden is suffering from anything more than traits that characterised him in younger decades, such as foot-in-mouth disease and a tendency to talk too much. Neither of these is degenerative. In fact, Biden’s malapropisms have noticeably dropped off since he became president while his prolixity is limited by the White House teleprompter. There are some grounds to suspect he is getting more forgetful — he implied twice last year that Taiwan was a formal ally of the US, a claim his staff had to correct. But there are none to suggest he is senile or suffering from dementia.



Yet that will not stop Biden’s age from becoming a liability. It already is. The president’s official line is that he is planning to run again. Just 41 per cent of Democratic voters believe Biden would have a better chance of winning the 2024 election than another Democratic candidate. The equivalent number for Donald Trump among Republican voters is 57 per cent. Some of that gap is to do with age. Although Trump is only four years his junior, Biden will become the first sitting US president to turn 80 in November. It strains credulity to believe he could have sufficient energy at the end of his second term, when he would be 86.



Treating the topic as off-limits is not a solution. During the last campaign, Biden’s team briefly debated whether to declare he would be a one-term president. They rejected it on the grounds that would turn him into an instant lame-duck. That logic still holds. Even if Biden does plan to step down after his first term, as many Democrats predict, it would be self-defeating to make it known. Presidential power is a diminishing commodity. Voluntarily conceding more makes little sense.



Yet Biden dropped strong hints in the campaign that one term would be his fill. He described himself as a “bridge” to a younger cohort. Campaign staff depicted him as a “transitional figure”. Voters could be forgiven for having thought they were being asked to endorse a stop-gap president whose main role was to dispense with Trump and pave the way for the next generation.



That should still be Biden’s goal. Which brings us to the Harris predicament. It is commonplace in Washington for Harris to be dismissed as a lightweight who is stumbling in her duties. Opinion polls back that up. A recent one has her at the lowest rating of any vice-president in modern US history. It may be true that Harris could not win the presidency — let alone be a successful leader — but Biden’s White House is not giving her much chance to disprove that.



Among recent vice-presidents, only Mike Pence, Trump’s number two, has had less Oval Office sway. Al Gore as Bill Clinton’s vice-president, Dick Cheney as George W Bush’s and Biden himself as Obama’s all played far larger roles. The assumption was that Harris was added to the ticket because of her identity — a non-white woman who could shield Biden from the impression he was a throwback. Having helped Biden win the election, Harris appears to have served her main purpose.



Though Harris has several nominal roles, the public seems only to have noticed that of stemming migration from Central America’s “northern triangle”. The term poisoned chalice springs to mind. Given Central America’s endemic corruption, Biden might as well have asked her to fix Afghanistan. It would be more far-sighted to hand over easier wins, such as fighting corporate monopolies or, given her prosecutorial skills, helping urban mayors like New York’s Eric Adams to combat crime — and reform (not “defund”) the police. That would cast Harris in a different light.



Succession planning is always a fraught business. The risk is that Biden wants to run again but will change his mind at the last moment. Treating Harris as a spent asset is self-fulfilling. Building up a field of potential successors — his vice-president among them — is Biden’s only responsible insurance policy."
18,BW_Doc1_Climate_Biden.docx,"In 2020, Joe Biden ran for president on the most ambitious climate action platform of any major presidential candidate in U.S. history. As President Biden reaches the midway point of his first term in office, it’s time to take stock of what his administration has accomplished, what is still a work in progress, and what is off track.  

In 2021, with Biden’s signature Build Back Better legislation stalled in Congress, I graded the administration’s overall climate performance “incomplete.” Fortunately, with a new name and moderate revisions to its climate policy features, Biden was able to sign the Inflation Reduction Act into law in August 2022, raising his overall climate grade to a strong A-. But he will need to stay focused and implement superbly to maintain, and hopefully further improve, his grade.

Here’s how the Biden administration has performed so far across 10 key climate priorities: 

Achieved 

1. Commit to cut total greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030: Achieved. 

In April 2021, President Biden set a new national goal to reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030, formalizing it in an updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Achieving this goal will be a major challenge, but it remains within reach thanks to progress made in 2022 (see #2).  

2. Pass a major climate-smart economic stimulus package after COVID-19: Achieved. 

Congress enacted the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, the largest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history. Building on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) passed in 2021, the Inflation Reduction Act establishes a comprehensive set of clean energy incentives, mostly through decade-long tax credits for everything from electric vehicles to direct air capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide.  

Although official estimates peg the climate investments included in the Inflation Reduction Act at $370 billion over 10 years, most of the tax credits it established are uncapped, meaning that the total investment could be much greater if consumers and businesses aggressively take advantage of the incentives. Economic modeling indicates that the Inflation Reduction Act itself could reduce 2030 emissions by 1 billion tons, leaving a 0.5 billion ton gap to achieving the U.S. 2030 emissions target — a gap that could be closed by complementary federal regulations and state and local action. 

3. Tackle super pollutants. Achieved.

Super pollutants like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane are emitted in smaller quantities than carbon dioxide, but pound for pound trap much more heat. Tackling super pollutants is a key component of any comprehensive climate strategy.  

The Senate ratified the international Kigali Amendment on reducing HFCs in September 2022, and EPA has issued regulations to phase down HFCs, as directed by the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act enacted in 2020.  

In November 2022, the Biden administration released an updated Methane Action Plan, which includes 50 specific measures backed by $20 billion in funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act and annual appropriations. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a methane"
19,AT_Doc1_Days-Before-The.docx,"Days before the US government could start to run out of money and default on its debt, Congress has approved a deal to lift the country's borrowing limit.



US President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy hammered out the agreement after weeks of high-stakes budget negotiations to prevent global financial chaos.



It now awaits Mr Biden's signature to be signed into law.



This is how we got here and what it means.



So what is the debt ceiling?

Also known as the debt limit, this is a law that limits the total amount of money the government can borrow to pay its bills.



This includes paying for federal employees, the military, Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest on the national debt and tax refunds.



Every so often, US Congress votes to raise or suspend the ceiling so it can borrow more.



The cap currently stands at roughly $31.4tn (£25.2tn). That limit was breached in January, but the Treasury Department used ""extraordinary measures"" to provide the government with more cash while it figured out what to do.



Historically, it's a formality for Congress to raise the limit as needed, but in recent years, as the parties have become more polarised, they can't seem to agree on the terms.



Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that without more borrowing, the US will not have enough money to meet all of its financial obligations as soon as 5 June.



What's in the deal?

Last month, Republicans put forward a deal to keep spending for key agencies at 2022 levels during the next financial year - and limit growth to 1% annually over the next decade.



The proposal would have repealed key priorities of the Biden administration, such as student loan forgiveness and tax incentives for electric vehicles. They also wanted more work requirements for those receiving healthcare and food welfare.



They did not get all they wanted, but neither did Mr Biden's Democrats.



The deal means a freeze on non-defence budgets for 2024, followed by a 1% rise the following year and no budget caps after 2025.



What happens now?

The House of Representatives passed the 99-page bill on Wednesday, and the Senate passed the bill today.



Members of both political parties have expressed disquiet at the agreement.



On the right, some Republicans think it does not go far enough in curbing spending.



And on the other side, some Democrats are unhappy at the extra work requirements on some benefit recipients.



It now heads to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law.



What happens if the US defaults on its debt?

This has never happened before, so it is not entirely clear, but it would cause major economic damage.



The government would no longer be able to pay the salaries of federal and military employees, while Social Security cheques - payments that millions of pensioners in the US rely on - would stop. Companies and charities that count on government funds would be in peril."
20,FM_Doc3_Biden_Faces_Flak.docx,"WASHINGTON -- President Biden's new border strategy so far appears to have deterred the record migrant influx many feared following the expiration of Title 42, but the revised system is already proving vulnerable to lawsuits and political attacks from the right and left.

Mr. Biden's new course at the border relies on stiff consequences for illegal border crossings involving requests for asylum, while allowing tens of thousands of asylum seekers to enter the country each month by legal means.

Arrests of migrants crossing from Mexico illegally have dropped from the levels seen in the days leading up to Title 42's expiration, officials have said. Releases of migrants out of Border Patrol detention appeared to be slowing.

In the last couple of days, the U.S. Border Patrol has seen a 50% drop in arrests, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on CNN on Sunday. That decline brings daily crossings roughly in line with the lull experienced in January, when arrests across the U.S.-Mexico border fell to between 4,000 and 5,000 a day.

More migrants remaining in Mexico have decided to try making an asylum appointment using a new government app, rather than crossing illegally and risking a higher penalty if they are caught.

Still, the new approach is already angering some of Mr. Biden's fellow Democrats along with Republicans, with the former arguing the new restrictions on asylum seekers are inhumane, and the latter saying the policy is lax and continues to admit migrants who shouldn't be in the U.S.

Rep. Mark Green (R., Tenn.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the short-term drop isn't meaningful. ""The numbers have fallen off for a couple of days, but . . . they can't predict the peak,"" Rep. Green said Sunday, also on CNN.

""Overwhelmingly, when these cases get adjudicated, they're found that there was no such oppression and they're told to go back home,"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said in an interview, regarding migrants claiming asylum because of fears of persecution back home. ""But most of these people that come in illegally, we don't know where they are.""

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D., Texas) said the Biden administration was putting asylum seekers in danger by processing some of them in other countries rather than in the U.S.""I think it's bad policy,"" Mr. Castro said on the BBC's ""Americast"" podcast. ""I think it was bad when Donald Trump did it. I think it's bad that the Biden administration is choosing to take that course.""

The Biden administration is arguing that while deterrence measures are needed to persuade migrants not to cross into the U.S. illegally, people will eventually try the border unless they are given alternative legal ways into the country. Some say knocking down any major element of the approach could threaten to unravel everything.

At the same time, the state of Florida sued and temporarily blocked the use of an emergency practice the Biden administration had adopted of releasing migrants with temporary permission to live legally in the U.S. when Border Patrol stations become dangerously overcrowded."
21,AK_Doc3_Biden_Admin_COVID.docx,"The Biden administration plans to end the Covid public health emergency this spring, as the U.S. shifts away from responding to the pandemic as a national crisis and instead manages the virus more like a seasonal respiratory disease.



The White House, in a statement on Monday, said it would terminate on May 11 the public health and national emergencies that the Trump administration first declared in 2020.



The statement issued by the Office of Management and Budget expressed the White House’s strong opposition to House Republican legislation aiming to immediately end the emergency declarations.



The public health and national emergencies have enabled hospitals and other health-care providers to respond more flexibly when faced with spikes in patient volume during Covid surges.



Enrollment in Medicaid also has surged because Congress basically barred states from withdrawing people from the program, citing the public health emergency.



A provision tucked in federal spending legislation passed in December allows states to start withdrawing people from Medicaid in April.



Although the emergency declarations will remain in place until spring, the federal response to the pandemic has already been scaled back as funding has dried up. Congress has failed for months to pass a White House request for $22.5 billion in additional funding for the Covid response.



The Health and Human Services Department has promised to give states 60 days notice before ending the emergency so the health-care system has time to prepare for a return to normal.



The public health emergency has been extended every 90 days since January 2020 as the virus has evolved into new variants and thrown repeated curveballs over the past three years. HHS just extended the emergency earlier this month.



The OMB said abruptly ending the emergencies in the way laid out in the Republican legislation would “create wide-ranging chaos and uncertainty throughout the health care system.”



Terminating the declarations without giving hospitals time to adjust would lead to “disruptions in care and payment delays, and many facilities around the country will experience revenue losses,” according to the OMB statement.



It would also “sow confusion and chaos” in the process of winding down the Medicaid-coverage protections, OMB said.



The White House is also planning to transition the Covid vaccines to the private market in the near future, though the exact timing is unclear. This means the cost of the vaccines would be covered by patients’ insurance policies rather than the federal government.



Moderna and Pfizer have both said they may charge as much as $130 per dose of vaccine, quadruple what the federal government pays.



Covid has killed more than 1 million people in the U.S. since 2020. Deaths have dropped dramatically since the pandemic peak during winter 2021, but nearly 4,000 people are still succumbing to the virus every week."
22,JMK_Doc3_Covid’s-deadly-trade-offs-by-the-numbers-How-each-state-has-fared-in-the-pandemic.docx,"From the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, the toughest decisions about how to combat the virus fell on state leaders. Which businesses should stay open and which should shut their doors? Should schools close and for how long? Should masks be mandated?The answers weren’t obvious. State officials had limited information about the virus, and the trade-offs were difficult. Protect residents’ health and instruct them to stay home – but risk driving companies out of business and accelerating unemployment. Keep businesses open – but risk a rise in hospitalizations and deaths. Close schools to control spread – but risk damaging kids’ education.There was no optimal way to make those choices, and we’re still debating them. But nearly two years after the first cases of Covid-19 were detected in the United States, we are beginning to get enough data to start assessing the implications of those policy choices.POLITICO’s State Pandemic Scorecard pulls together what we know so far about how states fared during the pandemic, and how the choices each made impacted its residents, businesses and schools. The scorecard groups available data for policy outcomes into four categories — health, economy, social well-being and education — and generates scores in each area between zero and 100."
23,JS_Doc2_Financial-Regulation-Climate.docx,"Financial Regulation, Climate Change, and Climate-related Risk Disclosure



Quick Take

The SEC issued a proposed climate risk disclosure rule in March 2022 that would require companies to disclose information about financial and business risks posed by climate change. A final rule is expected by fall 2023.

Why it Matters

The impacts of climate change pose enormous risk to the U.S. financial system. These risks can be physical, such as damaged infrastructure and transportation networks due to increasingly severe weather events, wildfires, and sea-level rise, or transitional, such as investment values changing with underlying shifts in energy and climate policy or consumer demand. This climate-related risk results in financial risk for businesses and investors. At the same time, a growing number of companies are setting net-zero goals and other GHG emissions targets, but their reporting is too fragmented and inconsistent to be useful to investors and regulators. Financial regulators are taking steps to understand how climate risks can affect companies, investors, and financial markets.

many investors are demanding information on climate-related risks, and companies have started to build out their disclosures in response. Concerned that voluntary climate disclosures do not adequately protect investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that additional disclosure requirements are necessary to provide consistent, comparable information about climate risks in the financial markets.

The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose a range of information related to business risks through regular filings. As part of the SEC’s mission to protect investors and maintain fair markets, the commission has broad authority to promulgate disclosure requirements that are “necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.” (15 USC 77g, 15 USC 78l, 78m, and 78o)

In addition to the SEC, other financial regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the Department of Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Department of Labor’s Employment Benefits Security Administration have taken action to understand and address climate-related risk in the financial sector.

Current Status

In March 2022, the SEC released a climate risk disclosure rule proposal that would require publicly traded companies to provide information about the climate-related risks that the business faces, and a final rule is expected this fall. In addition, SEC issued two proposed rules for ESG funds and other financial regulators have taken steps to incorporate climate risk.

Mar. 21, 2022 The SEC proposes a new rule with requirements for publicly traded companies to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and periodic reports, including information regarding climate risks (such as how extreme weather and energy transitions might affect their business), and certain climate-related financial statement metrics. The regulation would also require registrants in certain cases to disclose direct greenhouse gas emissions associated with their customers and suppliers, as well as emissions associated with purchased electricity. Additionally, the proposal would require companies that advertise emissions reduction goals to detail how they plan to achieve these goals, their reliance on carbon offsets, and their progress so far."
